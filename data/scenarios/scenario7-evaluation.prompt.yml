      Advisor: Good day Mrs. Miller, my name is Sarah Weber from HealthSwiss. How can I help you today?
      Mrs. Miller: Good day. I heard that premiums are increasing again. Can you tell me what I'll have to pay next year?
      Advisor: Certainly. I see you currently have a CHF 300 deductible. For next year, your monthly premium would be CHF 387, which is an increase of CHF 23 per month.
      Mrs. Miller: That's quite a bit more! Isn't there a way to reduce this?
      Advisor: Absolutely, there are several options. If you increase your deductible to CHF 2,500, you would save CHF 98 per month - so only CHF 289 per month. Given your health history with only routine checkups, this could make a lot of sense.
    expected: "Should provide detailed scoring and constructive feedback on tone/style and content quality in the context of Swiss health insurance consultation"
