      Advisor: Good day Mr. Smith, thank you for your call. You're interested in supplementary insurance for your family?
      Mr. Smith: Yes exactly. My wife is pregnant, our son will soon need braces, and we're also interested in alternative medicine.
      Advisor: I understand. Congratulations on the pregnancy! For your situation, I recommend a package of three components: First, our semi-private hospital insurance for better birth care. Second, children's dental insurance - it covers 75% of braces costs up to CHF 10,000. And third, our complementary medicine insurance with CHF 3,000 coverage per year.
      Mr. Smith: That sounds good. What would this cost and can we still sign up despite the pregnancy?
      Advisor: The complete package costs about CHF 280 per month for the whole family. Regarding pregnancy: there's a 12-month waiting period for hospital insurance, but for the upcoming birth, we could arrange a one-time coverage.
    expected: "Should evaluate needs capture, solution orientation, and advisor's transparency"
