      Advisor: Good day Mr. Weber, I've seen that you might be paying too much for your health insurance. May I show you how to save up to CHF 150 per month?
      Mr. Weber: I've been with my insurer for 25 years and very satisfied. Why would I switch?
      Advisor: I absolutely understand your loyalty, that speaks well of you. But did you know that basic insurance is identical at all insurers? It's legally mandated. The only difference is the price. For the same coverage, you currently pay CHF 520, we could offer you exactly the same coverage for CHF 370.
      Mr. Weber: But what about my supplementary insurance? I lose that when switching, right?
      Advisor: No, that's a common misunderstanding. You can switch your basic insurance and keep your supplementary - they are two separate contracts. Or we can also review your supplementary, you might save there too.
      Mr. Weber: And my ongoing physiotherapy? Will there be problems?
      Advisor: Not at all. For basic insurance, there are no waiting periods and no reservations for pre-existing conditions. Your physiotherapy treatments will continue seamlessly without interruption.
    expected: "Should evaluate the quality of objection handling, especially empathy, factual accuracy, and persuasiveness"
